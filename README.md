# Nuts

Nuts is a simple (and smart) application to serve desktop-application releases.

![Schema](./docs/schema.png)

It uses GitHub as a backend to store assets, and it can easily be deployed to Heroku as a stateless service. It supports GitHub private repositories (useful to store releases of a closed-source application available on GitHub).
