# Nuts Documentation

Nuts is a simple (and smart) application to serve desktop-application releases.

It uses GitHub as a backend to store assets, and it can easily be deployed to Heroku as a stateless service. GitHub private repositories are supported (useful to store releases of a closed-source application available on GitHub).

Please make sure that you use the documentation that match your Nuts version (Latest version is **{{ book.version }}**).
