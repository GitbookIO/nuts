# Upload assets for releases

Nuts uses GitHub Releases and assets to serve the right file to the right user.

See GitHub guides: [About Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/about-releases/) & [Creating Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/).

### Naming

Nuts uses some filename/extension conventions to serve the correct asset to a specific request:

The platform/OS will be detected from the filename:

- Windows: filename should contain `win`
- Mac/OS X: filename should contain `mac` or `osx`
- Linux: filename should contain `linux`

By default releases are tagged as 32-bits (except for OSX), but 64-bits will also be detected from filenames.

Filetype and usage will be detected from the extension:

| Platform | Extensions (sorted by priority) |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Windows | `.exe`, `.nupkg`, `.zip` |
| OS X | `.dmg`, `.zip` |
| Linux | `.AppImage`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.zip` |
